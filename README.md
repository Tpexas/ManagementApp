# ManagementApp
This was my first project with Spring Boot for Java lecture. I made simple hospital management with CRUD functionality for patients, doctors, appointments and consultations. I implemented user authentication and used roles for patients, receptionists and administrators which have different privileges. There is basic search function for doctors, also tables in admin panel are sortable.
